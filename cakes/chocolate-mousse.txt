Chococlate mousse recipe
From: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/jul/22/how-to-make-chocolate-mousse

Makes 2

2 medium eggs
60g chocolate (at least 70% cocoa)
2 tsp sugar (or to taste)

1. Break the chocolate into pieces and put in a bowl over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water. When the chocolate begins to melt, turn the heat off. Separate the eggs.

2. Whisk the egg whites into soft peaks, add the sugar, and whisk briefly.

3. Mix the egg yolks quickly into the melted chocolate and then whisk in a third of the egg white. Fold the rest very gently into the mixture until just combined (be careful not to overmix), and then put into bowls and refrigerate for at least four hours until set

This sounds very, very good!
