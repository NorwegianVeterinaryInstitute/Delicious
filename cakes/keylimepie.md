# Key Lime Pie

## Ingredients
Biscuit base:

- 300 g digestive biscuits

- 175 g melted butter (I usually use less, around 100g, but this is what 
the 
recipe says...)

Filling:

- 8 egg yolks

- 800 g sweetened condensed milk (2 cans, NOT Vikingmelk, this one isn't 
sweetened!)

- 2.5 dl lime juice (fresh)

- 2 teaspoons lime zest

Topping:

- Whipped cream/meringue (whatever you prefer)

- Lime pieces


## Preparation
Crush the biscuits well (I use a kitchen machine for this, or you can 
put them in a bag and crush them with a rolling pin) and mix with the 
melted butter. Press the mixture into a 24 cm cake tin, make sure to 
press it into the bottom and the rim, to create an even layer with 
edges. Bake at 175 degrees C for 10 - 12 minutes, and cool. (I usually 
press it down a bit before it cools completely, as it usually puffs up 
quite a bit).

Turn the oven down to 150 degrees C (not Fahrenheit :-).

Whip egg yolks and condensed milk together, and add the lime juice and 
zest. Mix well, the mixture should be even and smooth. Pour the mixture 
into the cooled biscuit base and bake at 150 degrees C for around 25 
minutes - the filling should be soft in the center (I usually knock on 
the oven to see if its still very wiggly - if it is, let it sit for a 
few more minutes). Cool the cake completely, then let it sit in the 
fridge for at least one hour or overnight.

Add topping to the cake or enjoy it as-is. It is especially good with 
vanilla-flavoured whipped cream!

Enjoy!
